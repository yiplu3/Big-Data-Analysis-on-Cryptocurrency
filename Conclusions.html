				<p>In this project, we focused on one subreddit of our interest, Cryptocurrency, as it is one of the most highly discussed and controversial topics in the technological field. Through analysis of word importance, it is surprising that people’s discussion about cryptocurrency on Reddit is much more technical than we initially expected as we come across jargon such as PoW (proof of work), fork, and POP network frequently. Apparently, people are comfortable using Reddit as a platform to conduct in-depth technical conversations. Moreover, based on sentiment analysis, we found that the majority of people are quite positive towards popular cryptocurrency titles such as Bitcoin and Ethereum as well as protocols such as Polygon and Algorand, indicating that people who are interested in cryptocurrency are confident and optimistic about this new technology. However, data on Bitcoin shows that the hype for cryptocurrencies can be really transient. Before November 2021, Bitcoin often led to heated discussions in the subreddit when price underwent drastic changes, but soon after, fewer and fewer people were discussing Bitcoin on Reddit as Bitcoin’s price dropped to an all-time low in May 2022. It suggests that a considerable amount of people had lost faith in the crypto and probably withdrawn from the market. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we established two machine learning models: one (model 1) that creates tags for Reddit comments to classify them into different sub-communities of cryptocurrency, and another one (model 2) that determines whether a comment is controversial or not based on features such as the time of post, score, whether it is distinguished/gilded, etc. It is found that score has the greatest impact on the prediction of comment controversiality.

				<p>So far, we have laid the groundwork for building functions that could actually be useful as new features of Reddit. We also design plans to improve both of our machine-learning models so that they could have more value in real-life applications. 
</p>
<p>
For model 1, we plan to generalize the model by training on potentially the whole Pushshift Reddit dataset with data from all subreddits available. This would allow the model to not only be able to create tags for comments within a certain subreddit but also suggest other subreddits that are strongly correlated, providing more exposure to related but potentially overlooked subreddits. 
</p>
<p>
  For model 2, we reckon it could be integrated into Reddit so that if a comment is determined to be highly controversial, the comment would be blurred for the viewer at first. A confirmation system could be implemented as well, which reveals the hidden message upon the view’s acknowledgment. To achieve this, the model needs to be upgraded so that it is able to conduct multiclass classification instead of binary. With multiple degrees of controversiality, we will be able to establish a threshold that determines whether or not a comment should be displayed directly.
