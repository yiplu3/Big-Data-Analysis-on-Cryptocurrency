				<p>Reddit is a network of communities where people can dive into their interests, hobbies, and passions. It has a massive collection of forums where people can share news and content or comment on other people’s posts. The most important feature of Reddit is its anonymity. On Reddit, users can use its service without revealing any personal information. 
</p>
<p>At the same time, cryptocurrency transactions also embed the anonymity characteristic. Therefore, people who are interested in cryptocurrencies have strong intentions to discuss the topic on Reddit, which makes the cryptocurrency community become one of the biggest on Reddit.

				<p>Given the popularity of cryptocurrency, we would like to take a glance at people’s opinions about cryptocurrency with the craze of cryptos emerging one after another. In this project, we explore the data about subreddits and comments that belong to the cryptocurrency community in the past year. How much has the cryptocurrency community on Reddit grown over the period of time? Which cryptocurrency receives the most attention? What time period is the crypto discussion more heated? We expect to answer these questions by observing and analyzing the data.
</p>
<p>
 Furthermore, we want to dig into the text of submissions and comments to figure out what exactly people discuss. With the popularity of cryptocurrencies, what are the most important topics or factors people care about regarding cryptocurrencies ?  What’s people’s attitude on Reddit posts and comments that mention the buzzwords? These questions will be examined through different natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.

					<h2> Appendix </h2>
				</div>
				<h3>Business goal 1:</h3>
				<p> EDA: How much has the cryptocurrency community on Reddit grown over the period of time in the given data and which cryptocurrency receives the most attention?</p>
				<h3>Technical proposal:</h3>
				<p>Determine the total count of submissions/comments by month. Plot the total count against time to explore the trend in growth. Use Regex to find submissions and comments that include keywords such as “bitcoin”, “dogecoin”, “tether”, “ethereum”. Conduct counts on those submissions and comments by month and by year, together with the total count of each currency. Tabulate the result to see which which cryptocurrency behaves the best.</p>
				<h3>Business goal 2:</h3>
				<p>EDA: Whether the cryptocurrency-related discussions are highly rated on Reddit, can we trust the labels given by Reddit such as gilded?</p>
				<h3>Technical proposal:</h3>
				<p>Determine the distribution of scores (upvotes - downvotes) for cryptocurrency subreddit submissions by distinguished and gilded variables. Produce a violine plot to visualize the distribution. Find the basic distribution statistics and check whether cryptocurrency subreddits are highly rated.</p>
				<h3>Business goal 3:</h3>
				<p>EDA: When are people more willing to talk about cryptocurrency one day(during work hours or after-work hours)? Or What time period is the cryptocurrency discussion more heated?</p>
				<h3>Technical proposal:</h3>
				<p>Explore the daily activity of subreddits and determine when is Reddit the most active throughout a week. Create three dummy variables during three time periods 0:00 am- 7:59 am (Sleep), 8:00 am-15:59 pm (working time), and 16:00 pm-23:59 pm(Afterwork).</p>
				<h3>Business goal 4:</h3>
				<p>EDA: How many words should a poster write in the comment to gain a high score, get distinguished, or get gilded under cryptocurrency-related subreddits?</p>
				<h3>Technical proposal:</h3>
				<p>First generate the new variable, the length of every comment under the subreddits related to cryptocurrencies. Then find the correlation between the comment length and variables distinguished/score/gilded by plotting the distribution of comment length based on scores(barplot), and dummy variables(distinguished/gilded)(violin plots). Also, compute the correlation coefficients between the comment length and variables distinguished/score/gilded.</p>
				<h3>Business goal 5:</h3>
				<p>NLP: With the popularity of cryptocurrencies, what are the most important topics or factors people care about regarding cryptocurrencies?</p>
				<h3>Technical proposal:</h3>
				<p>First split the sentences into words, stem, and delete stopwords. Then use CountVectorizer to count the number of words with real meanings. Finally, use TF-IDF to find the words’ importance and extract the most important words.</p>
				<h3>Business goal 6:</h3>
				<p>NLP: What’s people’s attitude on Reddit posts and comments that mention the buzzwords?</p>
				<h3>Technical proposal:</h3>
				<p>Reuse the most frequent words acquired earlier, and filter for the sentences that contain the buzzwords. Then perform sentiment analysis on the corpus. Use TextBlob and Vader to find the sentiment polarity. Also, do the data visualization of the sentimental polarity distribution.
				</p>
				<h3>Business goal 7:</h3>
				<p>NLP: For one of the most popular branches of cryptocurrency, how does sentiment related to bitcoin change with respect to its price?</p>
				<h3>Technical proposal:</h3>
				<p>Use NLP to identify posts that mention dogecoins, or look at future forms of dogecoins. Perform sentiment analysis on posts and assign a positive or negative value to each post. To determine the market development potential of dogecoin as an emerging virtual currency.</p>
				<h3>Business goal 8:</h3>
				<p>ML: We want to automatically generate the community that a post belongs to rather than let the poster find it themselves.</p>
				<h3>Technical proposal:</h3>
				<p>Based on the user's theme, we recommend what subreddit theme is suitable for him. Build a Naive Bayes model to determine the user's topic, and finally, use the model to suggest his own suitable topic for the new post.
				</p>
				<h3>Business goal 9:</h3>
				<p>ML:We want to help Reddit to find out whether a cryptocurrency’s comment is controversial or not.</p>
				<h3>Technical proposal:</h3>
				<p>First, properly choose important and distinct variables that can be used to predict controversial variables(dummy variable). And then utilize regression and clustering algorithms to predict the values of controversial variables. Finally, compare the real variables and predicted variables and get the algorithm prediction accuracy and find out whether the algorithm can be put into real-world implementation.</p>
				<h3>Business goal 10:</h3>
				<p>ML: We want to help Reddit to judge a cryptocurrency’s comment’s quality based on the overall ratings it received.</p>
				<h3>Technical proposal:</h3>
				<p>First, properly choose important and distinct variables that can be used to predict the score variable(integer variable). And then utilize clustering algorithms to predict the values of the score variable. Finally, compare the real variables and predicted variables and get the algorithm prediction accuracy and find out whether the algorithm can be put into real-world implementation.
